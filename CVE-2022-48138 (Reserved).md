## Title
Gladinet Centrestack - Unauthenticated Arbitrary Password Reset

## Description
An unauthenticated password reset vulnerability in the Password Reset Form of Gladinet CentreStack before version 13.5.9808 allows an unauthenticated attacker to arbitrarily change the password for any known user account and authenticate into the application.

## Proof of Concept
A request targeting an administrator's email address can be sent to the `/portal/ResetPassword.aspx` controller which will reset the password for a user account without knowing the original password.

At the request of the vendor, a full proof of concept script has not been generated.
