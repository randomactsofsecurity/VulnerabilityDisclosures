## Title
Extensis Portfolio - Admin Portal: Authenticated Archive Zip-Slip Path Traversal Resulting in Remote Code Execution

## Description
An unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the Backup/Restore Archive component of Extensis Portfolio v4.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted ZIP file.

## Proof of Concept
Malicious zip archive can be generated and submitted to the `/api/v1/backup/_restore?` controller which will automatically extract a malicous file, such as a web shell, to an attacker controlled location. At the request of the vendor, a full proof of concept script has not been generated.
