## Title
Fishbowl Inventory - Unauthenticated Java Deserialization

## Description
A Java Deserialization vulnerability in the Fishbowl Server in Fishbowl Inventory before 2022.4.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted XML payload.

## Proof of Concept
- TCP Socket Server parses incoming data streams; validates for JSON or XML data types
- In the XML flow, an XML document is built from the incoming data
- A custom XML parser is created which parses the XML structure, beginning with the root <event> tag
- The custom XML parser extracts data from the <head>, <user>, and <body> children elements.
- Within the <head> XML element parsing flow, the application base64 decodes a <src> child tag and converts the data within that <src> element into an arbitrary object input stream (using the Java readObject() function). 
- This directly leads to an exploitable deserialization condition as any arbitrary object can be provided in this element, such as an object which executes remote commands (called a Gadget Chain).

At the request of the vendor, a full proof of concept script has not been generated.
