## Title
LogicalDOC - Command Execution via Format Converters

## Description
OS Command Injection vulnerability in the LogicalDOC Community Version 8.8.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted path.

## Proof of Concept
Once logged into the LogicalDOC application with the Admin account, navigate to the Format Converter functionality (Administration -> Import and Export -> Format Converters). This section of the application allows the user to enable / disable various format converters and even edit specific parameters that will be utilized by the LogicalDOC application. One specific Format Converter that worked for Remote Code Execution is the ImageConverter. Specifying an Operating System command within the path parameter will be successfully executed upon attempting to convert files.

At the request of the vendor, a full proof of concept script has not been generated.
